# Assembly: Endgame (from Scrimba by BobZiroll)
A web-based game developed by using React, Typescript  and Vite that allows players to guess the correct letter for them to win the game in a limited number of attempts.<br />
The user will be recognized as winner only if has correctly guessed the right word which is randomly generated from a list of about 500 words. If won the user is rewarded with confetti.
